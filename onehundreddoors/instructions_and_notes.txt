Instructions

100 doors in a row are all initially closed. You make
100 passes by the doors. The first time through, you
visit every door and toggle the door (if the door is
closed, you open it; if it is open, you close it).
The second time you only visit every 2nd door (door
#2, #4, #6, ...). The third time, every 3rd door
(door #3, #6, #9, ...), etc, until you only visit
the 100th door.

Question: What state are the doors in after the last
pass? Which are open, which are closed?

The first four ports should finished as follows:
[open, closed, closed, open]

This is because on the first time all doors will be open.
On the second time only multiples of 2 will be closed and that includes
the fourth door.
On the third time all multiples of 3 will be closed.
On the fourth time all multilples of 4 will be toggled and because four is
multiple of two, it have been toggled on the second visit and because that the
final status of fourth door is openned.
